This directory is home to all files needed for successful completion of the 'Inheritance' project provided by ALX Africa to the Software Engineering program.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

(1) PYTHON SCRIPTS

	->	Allowed editors:
		    vi, vim, emacs
	->	All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:
		    python3 (version 3.8.5)
	->	All files should end with a new line
	->	The first line of all files should be exactly:
		    #!/usr/bin/python3
	->	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	->	Code should use:
		     pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
	->	All files must be executable
	->	The length of files will be tested using wc
	->	All  modules should have a documentation:
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
	->	All  classes should have a documentation:
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
	->	All  functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation:
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
	->	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

(2) PYTHON TEST CASES

	->	Allowed editors:
		    vi, vim, emacs
	->	All files should end with a new line
	->	All test files should be inside a folder tests
	->	All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
	->	All tests should be executed by using this command:
		    python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
	->	All  modules should have a documentation:
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
	->	All  functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation:
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
		     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
	->	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

(3) DOCUMENTATION

	->	No use of the words 'import' or 'from' inside comments, the checker will think these are attempts to import some modules
