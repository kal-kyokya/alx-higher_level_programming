This directory is home to all files needed for successful completion of the 0x0C-Almost_a_circle project provided by ALX Africa to the Software Engineering program.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

(1) PYTHON SCRIPTS

->	Allowed editors:
	    vi, vim, emacs
->	All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:
	    python3 (version 3.8.5)
->	All files should end with a new line
->	The first line of all files should be exactly:
	    #!/usr/bin/python3
->	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
->	Code should use:
	     pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
->	All files must be executable
->	The length of files will be tested using wc
->	All  modules should have a documentation:
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
->	All  classes should have a documentation:
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
->	All  functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation:
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
->	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

(2) PYTHON UNIT TESTs

->	Allowed editors:
	    vi, vim, emacs

->	The unittest module has to be used.
->	All test files should be python files (extension: .py)
->	All test files and folders should start with test_
->	The file organization in the tests folder should be the same as the project's:
	    Example: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in:
	    	tests/test_models/test_base.py
->	All tests should be executed by using any of commands:
	    python3 -m unittest discover tests
	    python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
->	All  modules should have a documentation:
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
->	All  functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation:
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
	     python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
->	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
